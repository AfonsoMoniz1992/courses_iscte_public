# courses_iscte_public

Teaching materials for the courses I teach at ISCTE. Each course lives in its own
directory so that students and colleagues can quickly find lecture slides,
assessments, and supporting references.

## Repository structure

- `uncertainty_and_decision_making_(transitional_year)/` â€“ Transitional year
  edition of the Uncertainty and Decision Making course. The folder is organised
  into lecture slide decks, past assessments with solutions, statistical
  formulae and tables, and complementary study resources.

## Contributing and updates

Materials are updated throughout the academic year as classes progress. If you
spot an issue or have updated content to share, feel free to open a pull
request.
